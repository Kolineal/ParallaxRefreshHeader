s.description      = <<-DESC
Basically this library is a combination of a ParallaxHeader from https://github.com/romansorochak/ParallaxHeader and pull to refresh https://github.com/Yalantis/PullToRefresh . It's modified to show the refresh view at the bottom of the header without messing up the inset/offset of the scroll view
